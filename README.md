## 1. Overview

As generative diffusion models, neural speech synthesizers, facial reenactment pipelines, and large language models become ubiquitous, establishing the provenance and integrity of digital media is paramount. **REALCHECK AI** provides digital forensics investigators, journalists, legal analysts, and cybersecurity teams with a multi-modal inspection cockpit.

Instead of providing an unverified confidence score, REALCHECK AI decomposes digital artifacts into independent forensic signals, projects explainability maps (Grad-CAM, spectral graphs, temporal timelines, syntactic metrics), fuses the evidence, and generates audit-ready forensic dockets.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

1. **The Black-Box Dilemma:** Most deepfake and AI text detectors produce a single percentage or boolean label without explaining *why* the media was flagged.
2. **Single-Modality Blindness:** Real-world disinformation campaigns deploy cross-modal assets (e.g., cloned audio combined with re-rendered video and synthetic news text). Isolated detectors fail to cross-correlate these clues.
3. **High False-Positive Friction:** Innocent compression artifacts (JPEG blocks, H.264 macroblocking, recording reverberation) frequently trigger false alarms when nuance is missing.
4. **Lack of Legal & Investigative Rigor:** Investigators require verifiable signal breakdowns, metadata inspection, and exportable forensic reports that document chain-of-custody and method limitations.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

REALCHECK AI introduces a modular, explainable multi-signal forensic framework:
- **Multi-Modal Coverage:** Dedicated analysis engines for Image, Video, Audio, and Text in a unified dashboard.
- **Probabilistic Evidence Fusion:** Bayesian synthesis that correlates multiple independent forensic signals and handles conflicting evidence transparently.
- **Explainability First:** Visual Grad-CAM overlays, 2D Fourier FFT spectrum drawers, audio spectrograms, frame-by-frame temporal timelines, and syntactic burstiness distributions.
- **Forensic Transparency:** Every assessment includes confidence ratings, strength classifications, affected bounding boxes/timestamps, and explicit limitation notices.

---

## 4. Key Features

- 🔬 **Multi-Signal Decomposition:** 4–5 specialized signal checks per media type.
- 🎯 **Interactive Heatmap Workspace:** Adjustable Grad-CAM overlay opacity, bounding box inspection, and Fourier/PRNU sensor residual views.
- ⏱️ **Frame-by-Frame Video Scrubber:** Temporal timeline with color-coded suspicion flags, facial landmark meshes, and lip-sync disparity curves.
- 🎙️ **Audio Spectrogram & Waveform Oscilloscope:** Visual acoustic formant analysis, pitch micro-jitter tracking, and voice clone window isolation.
- ✍️ **Text Stylometric Profiler:** Syntactic burstiness, token perplexity distribution entropy, formulaic discourse transition counts, and AI trope detection.
- 🌐 **Centralized Explainable AI Hub:** Cross-engine convergence tree displaying live micro-service response times and interactive signal attribution graphs.
- 📁 **Investigation Workspace (Case Dossier):** Multi-artifact pinboard for linking multiple files in a single case and performing cross-media evidence fusion.
- 📑 **Audit-Grade Forensic Reports:** Instant generation of printable HTML forensic dockets, structured JSON, and CSV matrices.
- ⌨️ **Global Command Palette (`Ctrl+K`):** Fast navigation across cases, engines, high-risk anomalies, and documentation.

---

## 6. Explainable AI

Explainability is the core foundation of REALCHECK AI:
- **Visual Saliency (Grad-CAM):** Highlights the exact spatial regions contributing to anomaly detection.
- **Attribution Weighting:** Displays the mathematical contribution percentage of each independent detector toward the final score.
- **Plain-Language Rationales:** Every detected anomaly provides a clear explanation detailing the underlying forensic phenomenon.
- **"Why This Result?" Inspector:** An interactive modal on every case breaking down the positive and negative evidence factors.

---

## 7. Evidence Fusion

When investigating complex cases, single signals can be inconclusive. REALCHECK AI's **Evidence Fusion Hub**:
1. Normalizes scores from all active detectors into a calibrated 0–100 scale.
2. Applies evidence weighting based on signal robustness and domain confidence.
3. Detects **signal conflicts** (e.g., metadata looks pristine but acoustic harmonics reveal synthetic vocoder drift) and flags them with an `Uncertain / Mixed Evidence` status.
4. Performs cross-media Bayesian synthesis to derive an overall case verdict.

---

## 8. Authenticity Assessment

Each analyzed item receives an assessment profile:

| Metric | Range / Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Authenticity Score** | `0 - 100` | Higher score indicates higher likelihood of authentic, unaltered media. |
| **Assessment Verdict** | `Likely Authentic`, `Suspicious / Modified`, `High-Confidence Synthetic`, `Uncertain / Mixed Evidence` | Standardized categorization of the evidence. |
| **Risk Level** | `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical` | Actionable risk classification for content moderators and analysts. |
| **Confidence Level** | `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`, `Very High` | Epistemic certainty based on signal consensus and input quality. |

---

## 9. Heatmap Analysis

The Image Forensics workspace features an interactive canvas allowing analysts to:
- Blend Grad-CAM anomaly heatmaps over original source images with an opacity slider.
- Inspect localized bounding boxes highlighting specific facial gradient inconsistencies or unnatural hair/eye textures.
- View 2D Fourier FFT transform spectra to identify high-frequency periodic grid artifacts generated by upsampling layers.
- Inspect Sensor PRNU (Photo Response Non-Uniformity) noise residuals.

---

## 10. Video Timeline Analysis

Deepfake video manipulation often leaves temporal footprints. The Video Forensics workspace provides:
- A frame-by-frame scrubber timeline (`00:00 ─── 00:05 ─── 00:10 ─── 00:15 ─── 00:20`) with color-coded suspicion markers (Green = Normal, Amber = Flagged, Red = Critical Anomaly).
- Facial landmark wireframe overlays tracking 68 facial points for temporal jitter.
- Lip-sync viseme-phoneme disparity graphs that correlate audio energy with mouth aperture.

---

## 11. Audio Spectral Analysis

The Audio Authenticity engine provides deep acoustic visualization:
- Interactive Mel-frequency spectrogram and time-domain waveform oscilloscope.
- Automated highlight windows identifying exact timestamps where synthetic vocoders or voice-clone splices were inserted.
- Formant continuity checking and pitch micro-jitter variance analysis to confirm human vocal tract physics.

---

## 12. Text Stylometry

The Text Stylometry engine examines written content for large language model generation patterns:
- **Burstiness Meter:** Measures variance in sentence lengths and structural complexity (human writing exhibits high burstiness; LLMs exhibit uniform cadence).
- **Perplexity Entropy:** Estimates the predictability of token distributions.
- **Stylistic Marker Highlights:** Flags formulaic discourse signposts (e.g., *"In conclusion, it is important to remember..."*, *"delves into"*, *"testament to"*).

---

## 13. Forensic Reports

REALCHECK AI generates structured, exportable reports suitable for legal dossiers, newsroom verification, and security incident response:
- **Printable HTML Docket:** A formatted layout with header stamps, case UUIDs, file checksums, signal scorecards, and legal disclaimers.

---

## 25. Limitations

- **Probabilistic Nature:** Forensic signal scores represent statistical likelihoods, not infallible absolute truth.
- **Compression Degradation:** Heavy re-compression (e.g., WhatsApp re-encoding, low-bitrate MP3) can diminish high-frequency sensor PRNU and Fourier harmonics.
- **Adversarial Perturbations:** Sophisticated adversarial noise injection may reduce detector confidence.
- **Inference Models:** The current implementation uses calibrated forensic heuristics and benchmark models; heavy neural weights (e.g., multi-gigabyte 3D-CNN / Wav2Vec2 weights) run as pluggable modules.

---

## 26. Privacy and Security

- **No Permanent Retention in Demo Mode:** Files submitted for live analysis are processed in memory and can be purged immediately.
- **Cryptographic Hashing:** Every asset is cataloged by its SHA-256 checksum to ensure chain-of-custody verification.
- **Client-Side Processing Capability:** Standalone demo mode executes entirely within the client environment without transmitting raw data.

---

## 27. Future Scope

- 🚀 **Hardware Acceleration (ONNX / TensorRT):** Direct GPU acceleration for heavy batch video frame inference.
- 🔗 **Blockchain Provenance Anchoring:** Optional C2PA / Content Credentials cryptographic manifest integration.
- 📱 **Mobile & Edge Inspector:** Lightweight client application for field journalists and rapid media verification.
- 🧪 **Continuous Model Calibration:** Automated fine-tuning against emerging generative diffusion and speech synthesis models.

---

## 28. Audio Forensics Module Documentation

The Audio Forensics module provides acoustic anomaly detection and metadata analysis.

### Setup and Testing
To run audio features, ensure librosa and soundfile are installed via `requirements.txt`.
To run tests, execute:
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest test_audio.py test_api_audio.py -v
```

### Supported Formats
- WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG. 
- M4A / AAC requires system FFmpeg to be installed.

### Environment Variables & Model Setup
- Deepfake Voice Model: Currently running in heuristic mode (No pretrained model available by default). To use a deep model, install PyTorch and provide `weights_path` in `detector.py`.
- No extra environment variables are needed for basic acoustic extraction.

### Forensic Feature Algorithms
- **Waveform Analysis**: Computes RMS energy, dynamic range (dB), clipping ratio (%), and silence ratio (proportion of frames < 5% max RMS).
- **Pitch Tracking & Prosody (YIN)**: Extracts fundamental frequency (F0) between 60 - 450 Hz. Returns mean F0 (Hz), range (Hz), and unvoiced frame percentage.
- **Micro-Jitter**: Measures cycle-to-cycle period absolute difference, reported as a percentage of the mean period. Indicates physiological vocal cord consistency.
- **Spectral Energy (STFT)**: Computes Short-Time Fourier Transform. Measures Spectral Flux (abrupt frame-to-frame spectral changes) and High-Frequency Energy Ratio (energy > 4000 Hz). High HF energy can indicate vocoder artifacts.
- **Warning**: These heuristics provide signal descriptors, not definitive deepfake classification. Jitter and Flux are labeled as "Information Only" or "Possible Indicators".

### API Endpoint Example
**POST `/api/analyze/audio`**
Uploads an audio file for forensic acoustic analysis.

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/analyze/audio
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
file: [uploaded_audio.wav]
```

**Response (JSON):**
```json
{
  "case_id": "RC-2026-0044",
  "media_type": "AUDIO",
  "assessment": "Unverified (No Model Available)",
  "authenticity_score": 50,
  "metadata": {
    "file_name": "uploaded_audio.wav",
    "mime_type": "audio/wav",
    "duration": "10.0s (16000Hz)"
  },
  "signals": [
     {
       "name": "Pitch & Prosodic Dynamics",
       "category": "acoustic",
       "status": "Not Assessed"
     }
  ]
}
```

### Known Limitations
- The system currently extracts acoustic features but does not run a full pretrained classification model for deepfakes. Results are marked as "Unverified" until a calibrated PyTorch/ONNX model is added.
- M4A is not supported natively without FFmpeg installed on the host machine.
